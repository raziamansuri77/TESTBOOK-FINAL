            <div class="card1-box1-text1">
              Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or
              a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
              corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
              motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what
              stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for
              designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
              embraces design and allows it to succeed.

            <div class="card1-box1-text1">
              In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of
              organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will
              share what those teams, departments, and companies have that
              others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your
              own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of
              design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.s

              Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only
              with a combination of well-written narrative and effective
              storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this
              together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and
              techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize
              information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that
              together comprise a well-told story.

            <div class="card1-box1-text1">
              With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in
              design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to
              communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as
              cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider
              why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.

              JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries

              Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process.
              Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch
              together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic
              interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is
              even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves
              the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid
              prototyping.
